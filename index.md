# About me
I am a PhD student at the Indian Institute of Technology, Jammu (IIT-JMU), Jammu, Jammu and Kashmir, working with Dr. Sartaj Ul Hasan. Before joining IIT Jammu, I was a project fellow at the Harish Chandra Research Institute (HRI) Allahabad, Uttrar Pradesh (during Feb 2017 -- Nov 2017), under the mentorship of Prof. Kalyan Chakraborty and Prof. R. Thangadurai. I received my M.Sc degree in Mathematics from Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur (IIT-KGP) where I wrote my master's thesis under the supervision of Prof. Ratna Dutta.
