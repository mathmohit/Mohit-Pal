# About me
I am a PhD student at the Indian Institute of Technology, Jammu (IIT-JMU), Jammu, Jammu and Kashmir, working with [Dr. Sartaj Ul Hasan](https://sites.google.com/site/sartajulhasan/). Before joining IIT Jammu, I was a project fellow at the Harish Chandra Research Institute (HRI) Allahabad, Uttrar Pradesh (during Feb 2017 -- Nov 2017), under the mentorship of [Prof. Kalyan Chakraborty](http://www.hri.res.in/~kalyan/) and [Prof. R. Thangadurai](http://www.hri.res.in/~thanga/). I received my M.Sc degree in Mathematics from Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur (IIT-KGP) where I wrote my master's thesis under the supervision of [Prof. Ratna Dutta](http://www.facweb.iitkgp.ac.in/~ratna/).
